# Plot.ly Homework - Belly Button Biodiversity

We built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset from http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/
which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset revealed that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% 
of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

We used the D3 library to read in `samples.json`
We created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in an individual
We created a bubble chart that displayed each sample
